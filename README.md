# Ray Tracing

A GPU-accelerated real-time path tracer built with CUDA and C++ for realistic Path tracing, simulating physically based rendering (PBR) materials, accurate lighting, shadows, and reflections.

## Building and running
Officially supports Windows 10/11 and Visual Studio 2022 You'll need to have the [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/) and [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit)installed.

1. Clone recursively: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/PH03N1XGithub/CUDA-Path-Tracer.git`
2. Run `scripts/Setup.bat`
3. Open `PathTracing.sln` and hit F5 (Change configuration to ReleaseGPU)
